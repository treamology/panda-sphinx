Physics
=======

Panda3D offers four built-in choices to use for Physics:

-  :ref:` <panda3d-physics-engine>`: Panda3D has a very basic physics engine
   built-in that may apply forces to classes. The physics engine can handle
   angular or linear forces, as well as viscosity.
-  :ref:` <ode>`: This is a more extended physics engine that Panda3D offers
   good integration for, you will want to use this if you need more complex
   physics simulations. In Panda3D versions 1.5.3 and above, this is
   integrated in the binaries from the download page.
-  NVIDIA PhysX: New in 1.7.0. Not yet documented.
-  \ `Bullet Physics
   Engine <https://www.panda3d.org/manual/index.php/Using_Bullet_with_Panda3D>`__\ :
   New in 1.8.0.

When you have a very simple simulation, you will most likely want to use the
built-in physics, which works with Panda's collision system. Although, when
the built-in engine doesn't offer enough functionality for you, you can switch
to ODE, Bullet or PhysX.

Integration for various other physics engines have been provided by the
community on the forums:
